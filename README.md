# GrimDark - A Dark Fanatsy Mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights

A Dark Fantasy Mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights

GrimDark, the endless hungry forest - the peoples of the area cling to it's boundaries, using the open 
waterways for trade and communication and shunning the haunted shadows of the trees. Over the centuries, 
many expeditions have set off to settle the forest never to return, and the brave woodcutters, rangers and 
adventurers who dare to push deeper into the forest return with tales of ruined villages, slavering cannibals 
and horrific monsters, if they return at all.

Change from base game:

- Zombies don't revive without magical assistance.
- Forest is the default land terrain to represent the sprawl of the GrimDark
- All roads have been replaced with forest trails

Planned Future Content

- Three large static trading towns based around the rivers
- Randomly generated ruined settlements hidden in the forest
- Fortified homesteads, farms and mining settlments
